# React Project with Tailwind CSS, Axios, and JSON Server

This is a simple React project that utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling, Axios for making HTTP requests, and JSON Server for simulating a backend API. It's a great starting point for building small to medium-sized web applications with React.

## Features

- **React**: Utilizes React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Integrates Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework for quickly building custom designs.
- **Axios**: Utilizes Axios for making HTTP requests to interact with the JSON Server API.
- **JSON Server**: Uses JSON Server to provide a RESTful API for mock data, making it easy to develop and test without a real backend.
